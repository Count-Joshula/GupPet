# GupPet
Unofficial changes to the WoW addon GupPet.

Used latest version I could find as my starting point. That version was based on grimmtooth's changes. Updated with the help of AI tools.

Change Log:
I'm not a coder so this is pretty basic:

- updated code with as much "future-proofing" as possible
- removed ability to customize in-game button(s)
- changed Addon UI icon
- changed minimap icon to match addon icon
- changed all in-game icons for consistency
- updated worgen functionality: if Dark Flight option checked, always use Dark Flight for ground; if unchecked, add to ground mount list
- added dracthyr option similar to worgen: if Soar option checked, always use Soar for flight; if unchecked, add to flying mount list
- 

Mount Types:
I discovered that there are so many different unique mount types because each type has something that makes it stand out. All mounts of that type move, bank, or share some unique animation. Sometimes there's only one! Here is a complete list of the types:

230 - most ground mounts
231 - aquatic + land (Riding Turtle and Sea Turtle)
232 - Vashj'ir Seahorse (aquatic and only useable in Vashj'ir)
241 - Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow Qiraji Battle Tank (restricted to use inside Temple of Ahn'Qiraj)
242 - Swift Spectral mounts (hidden in the mount journal, used while dead in certain zones)
247 - developer test type
254 - aquatic only (Subdued Seahorse, Brinedeep Bottom-Feeder, and Fathom Dweller)
284 - usable at level 1 (Chauffeured Mekgineer's Chopper and Chauffeured Mechano-Hog)
402 - flying with Ride Along
407 - Otterworldly Ottuk Carrier (flies, swims, and ground)
408 - Unsuccessful Prototype Fleetpod (ground, very slow)
411 - Whelpling (unobtainable or in-game special like Swift Special mounts)
412 - Iskaara Trader's Ottuk (ground only despite being ottuk)
424 - most flying mounts, including those that change capability based on riding skill
426 - dragonriding mount awarded by questing or completing objectives in Dragonflight
430 - Another whelpling (unobtainable or in-game special like Swift Special mounts)
436 - Aurelid or Fish (flying, ground, swimming)
437 - Disks and Wave Shredders
442 - Dracthyr Soar ability
